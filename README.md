üëã **Hello, amazing GitHub explorers!**

I am Vivek Chaugule.

It all started with the inquisitive mind of a 13-year-old, captivated by the inner workings of man-made wonders. The first rendezvous with a computer in the school lab marked the inception of my odyssey. From crafting my maiden C-program to sketching triangle patterns on the DOS Box Operating System, the thrill of understanding systems was irresistible.

This ignited my pursuit of a **Bachelor's in Computer Science**, where I delved into the intricacies of System and Web Programming, Computer Architecture, Databases, and Algorithms. Days and nights were devoted to constructing a line-following robot with an Arduino-C programming board, showcasing my prowess at local tech events, and culminating in crafting Android apps for the final project.

A self-taught aficionado of modern web applications, I immersed myself in learning **SPA (Angular-MongoDB) architecture**, paving the way to a promising role as an Angular developer in a dynamic startup based in Bangalore. The journey continued, contributing significantly to developing large-scale SaaS products and instilling a sense of accomplishment with every successful code run and real-world problem solved.

The hunger for knowledge propelled me to master the intricacies of web applications, leading to a pivotal role at **Wrinom Solutions** as a **Senior Software Engineer**. Here, I orchestrate multiple projects using Python, Java, Angular, and modern cloud architectures while exploring innovative applications of **LLM - ChatGPT** to empower web and mobile solutions.

Throughout this adventure, I've been able to boost development activities for three startups, generating value with high-quality code. Pursuing higher education in **Computer Engineering** further sharpened my skills, allowing me to lead research endeavours from low-level architecture to creating Python code that detects skin cancer from smartphone images.

And here's a fun fact: Outside the realm of coding, I'm an avid lover of mystery novels and can often be found engrossed in a gripping whodunit when not unravelling the mysteries of code. üìöüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
